% function ShiftAOI(AOInumber,FrameNumber,AOIinfo,DriftList)
%
% This function will provide the [deltax deltay] pixel shift for each AOI
% due to a drifting field of view.  The function uses the drift information
% contained in the 'Driftlist' variable to compute the relevant shifts.
%
% AOINumber == the number of the aoi (as numbered in AOIinfo) for which the
%           function computes a shift
% FrameNumber == the current frame number being displayed
% AOIinfo == the aoiinfo2 list of AOI centers and initial frame number, as
%            contained in the handles.FitData of imscroll
%             [framenumber ave x y pixnum aoinumber]
% DriftList == matrix of frame-by-frame shifts
%                [(frame number) (pixel shift x) (pixel shift y)]
%      [    1             0                   0
%           2   (x of frame 2)-(x of frame1) (y of frame 2)-(y of frame1)
%           3    (x of frame 3)-(x of frame2) (y of frame 3)-(y of frame2)
%                                        ...
%                                         ...
%       N   (x of frame N)-(x of frame N-1) (y of frame N)-(y of frameN-1)]
%
%  The routine will shift the aoi forward or backward depending on whether
%  the current frame number is greater or less than the frame number at
%  which the aoi was initially chosen.  This means that the aoi will always
%  be spatially fixed within the FOV (i.e. always moves with the drift of the FOV)
