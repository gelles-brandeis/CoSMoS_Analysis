%
% function glimpse_image(folder,gheader,image_number)
%
% Will retrieve one image from a glimpse-saved image sequence.
%
% folder == full path to the glimpse-saved folder containing the series of
%           glimpse files
% gheader == structure contained in the 'header.mat' file within the folder
%          specified by 'folder' variable.  The gheader members will be
%          for example:
%           moviefile: 'd:\glimpse\larryfj00269\header.glimpse'
%         username: 'larryfj'
%        description: [1x0 char]
%            nframes: 13206
%           time1: 3.2470e+009
%                ttb: [1x13206 double]
%          depth: 1
%         offset: [1x13207 double]
%     filenumber: [1x13207 double]
%          width: 302
%         height: 512 
%
% image_number == the image frame that the user wants this function to
%               retrieve and output from the glimpse-saved sequence
