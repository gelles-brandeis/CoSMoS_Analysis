%
% function draw_box(center_xy,x_radius,y_radius,linecolor)
%
% This function will draw a box centered at ( center_xy(1),center_xy(2) ) of the current
% figure.  The box will enclose an area of (2*x_radius+1)*(2*y_radius+1) pixels.
%
% center_xy == gives the coordinates of the box center as the (x,y) coordinate
%                of the current figure
% x_radius  == gives the distance (in pixels) from the box center to y edge of the box
% y_radius == gives the distance (in pixels) from the box center the x edge of the box
% linecolor  == ascii character giving the color of the line that will be
%                 drawn  e.g. ='[0 0 1]' for blue
%
% The box will be drawn with the corners given by the xy coordinates:
%   [x] = [center_xy(1)-x_radius  center_xy(1)+x_radius  center_xy(1)+x_radius  center_xy(1)-x_radius]
%   [y]   [center_xy(2)-y_radius  center_xy(2)-y_radius  center_xy(2)+y_radius  center_xy(2)+y_radius]
