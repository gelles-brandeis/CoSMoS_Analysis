function [ background ] = rolling_ball(image,R,H)
%rolling_ball(image, R, H) takes a single image and calculates a rolling
%ball background, with the necessary inputs as the image matrix, the radius
%and the height of the ball.  (Default R=15, H=5).
%   Prior to the morphological opening using a rolling ball, there is a
%   conservative disk averaging filter of 2-pixel radius to smooth the
%   background.  Presumably, any non-background objects biased by the
%   averaging filter are removed by the morphological opening.
